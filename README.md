The purpose of this application is to allow a user to generate a random password. 

By visiting the URL, any prospective employee will be able to create a secure password to use when accessing sensitive company data and other information. 

The password, ranging in length from 8-128 characters, will be displayed to the screen. The user will have the chance to copy this password to their clipboard. This will be particularly useful for longer character strings. 

HTML, CSS, and Javascript will all be used in the creation process.
